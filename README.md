# **Website Traffic Analysis with Decision Tree**

This project analyzes a dataset containing website traffic metrics and uses a Decision Tree model to predict conversion rates. The dataset includes metrics such as page views, session duration, bounce rate, traffic source, time on page, previous visits, and conversion rates.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains 2,000 entries with the following features:

.1.**Page Views:** The number of pages viewed during a session.

2.**Session Duration:** The total time spent on the website during a session (in seconds).

3.**Bounce Rate:** The percentage of sessions where the user leaves the website without interacting further.

4.**Traffic Source:** The origin of the website traffic (e.g., Organic, Social, Paid).

5.**Time on Page:** The average time spent on a specific page during a session (in seconds).

6.**Previous Visits:** The number of times the user has visited the website before the current session.

7.**Conversion Rate:** The percentage of sessions that resulted in a conversion (e.g., purchase, sign-up).


# **Objective**

The primary goal of this project is to build a Decision Tree model that can predict the **Conversion Rate** based on the other features in the dataset.
